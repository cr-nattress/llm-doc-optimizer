# User Story: Create Netlify Configuration

## Story
As a DevOps engineer, I want Netlify deployment configured so that the function builds and deploys automatically with proper settings.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] netlify.toml exists with build configuration
- [ ] Functions directory is specified
- [ ] Build command compiles TypeScript
- [ ] Environment variables are documented
- [ ] Function timeout is configured

## Technical Details
Create netlify.toml:
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  functions = "netlify/functions"
  publish = "dist"

[functions]
  node_bundler = "esbuild"
  
[functions.optimize]
  timeout = 10

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"

[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
```

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Netlify recognizes configuration
- [ ] Build process works locally with netlify dev
- [ ] Functions are bundled with esbuild
- [ ] Security headers are configured
