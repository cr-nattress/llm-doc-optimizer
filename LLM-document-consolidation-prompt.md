## Mission
Take all documents that have already been **LLM-optimized** (Markdown + JSON outputs) and consolidate them into a **single master document**.  

This consolidation should preserve all optimized structure, while merging like documents (e.g., handbooks, transcripts, meeting notes) into one unified reference.

## Rules

### 1. Preserve Truth & Structure
- Keep all original optimized text exactly as it appears.  
- Do **not paraphrase, rewrite, or drop** content.  
- Maintain all **stable IDs** (e.g., `sec-3-4-PTO`, `t=00:05:30`).  

### 2. Merge Like Documents
- Group related docs together (e.g., all policies into one section, all transcripts into another).  
- When merging, preserve **section order and IDs** so references from indexes remain valid.  
- Add a **source citation marker** at the start of each merged section (e.g., `Source: employee-handbook.pdf`).  

### 3. Normalize Metadata
- Each merged section should begin with a **metadata block**:  
  - Source file(s)  
  - Document type  
  - Date(s)  
  - Entities mentioned  
  - Token size (if available)  

### 4. Consolidated Index
At the top of the master file, generate a consolidated **table of contents**:
- Organized by document type (Handbooks, Policies, Transcripts, Emails, Notes, etc.)  
- Each entry links to the stable secti
